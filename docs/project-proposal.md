# Purrfect Neighbors Project Proposal

## 🐱 Project Overview

Our project aims to help users find their perfect pets, and help pets find warm homes. We also encourage the sharing and exchange of pet products and toys among users.
This system will utilize the Mapbox API to mark locations where users can adopt pets and find pet products around them. We will develop a search and filter algorithm to help users make informed decisions. The open data from Petfinders’ Free API will be used as the primary source for adoptable pets information, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

We aim to create a user-friendly platform that allows users to adopt pets, share and exchange pet products, by providing the following main features:

- User registration and profiles.
- Search and filter to help users find pets based on various criteria.
- Interactive map displaying locations of nearby adoptable pets and friendly pet products donations.
- Allow users to post about sharing or exchange, and make comments on the posts.
